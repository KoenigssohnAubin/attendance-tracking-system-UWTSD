# 1. Introduction

Bright Minds Academy, a small private tutoring centre recognised for its personalised learning approach, is seeking to modernise its student attendance tracking system. Currently, attendance is recorded manually using paper registers, which has become increasingly difficult to manage as student enrolment continues to grow. The academy is therefore looking for a straightforward digital solution that can efficiently record which students attended each class and when. 

This project addresses the need by developing a software-based Attendance Management System that replaces traditional manual processes with an automated, reliable, and scalable solution. The system is designed to improve efficiency, reduce errors, and simplify the management of attendance records. 

The report begins with requirements analysis to identify the specific goals of the system in line with the Bright Minds academyâ€™s needs. After that, the design phase illustrates the logical structure of the system through flowcharts and pseudocode, followed by implementation decisions concerning the use of data structures, programming constructs, and Python modules. The inclusion of the source code further demonstrates the translation of design into a working system. 

At the end of the report, a testing and debugging report is also provided. This section highlights the role of testing within the software environment, identifies common types of errors in programming, and presents example test cases to validate the system. 

Let start with the requirements analysis, the first part of this report.
